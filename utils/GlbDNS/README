GlbDNS version 0.29
===================

GlbDNS is a global load balancing DNS server. Partly inspired
by pgeodns -- it differs in that it uses the absolute position
of the DNS server to calculate which site is closest. All
other opensource servers I could find uses country level.
This doesn't work in the US. It also uses real zone files.
