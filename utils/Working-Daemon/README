Working-Daemon version 0.29
===========================

This is a modular Daemon wrapper. It handles forking, master session, chroot
pidfiles, and command line parsing.

While it isn't perfect yet, it works better than any existing
on CPAN. Notably it doesn't force itself on you unconditionally.

The commandline parsing uses Getopt::Long

It also supports start,stop,status and restart. So you can symlink your
daemon directly into init.d
