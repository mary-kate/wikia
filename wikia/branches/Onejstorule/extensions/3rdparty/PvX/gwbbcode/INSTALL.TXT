UPDATE
------

In the following, ~ will refer to your phpBB, PunBB or vBulletin directory. For PHP-Nuke, the forum directory is in the modules directory.

1) Copy the content of this archive into ~/gwbbcode/ and overwrite every file bug config.php
You do have to copy ~/gwbbcode/img_skills, or at least its new files, as a few PvE skills were added.

2) If you want the skill database to be stored and accessed with MySQL, set GWBBCODE_SQL to true in ~/gwbbcode/config.php

3) If you your skill database is stored with MySQL (see 2), update it by accessing ~/gwbbcode/install.php with your browser.

3) If you want builds with Kurzick/Luxon skills to be adapted to your alliance faction, set GWBBCODE_ALLEGIANCE to 'Kurzick' or 'Luxon' in ~/gwbbcode/config.php (Kurzick by default, so edit only if you are Luxon)



INSTALLATION
------------

In the following, ~ will refer to your phpBB, PunBB or vBulletin directory (if you can't modify files from these directory, you won't be able to install gwBBCode). For PHP-Nuke, the forum directory is in the modules directory.

1) Copy the content of this archive into ~/gwbbcode/ so that one can access ~/gwbbcode/install.php

2) If you use phpBB2, create ~/gwbbcode/pickup_db.php and make sure php scripts can modify it (chmod 666). So far only phpBB2 supports the pickup feature.

3) If you want the skill database to be stored and accessed with MySQL, set GWBBCODE_SQL to true in ~/gwbbcode/config.php

4) If you want builds with Kurzick/Luxon skills to be adapted to your alliance faction, set GWBBCODE_ALLEGIANCE to 'Kurzick' or 'Luxon' in ~/gwbbcode/config.php (Kurzick by default, so edit only if you are Luxon)

5) Access ~/gwbbcode/install.php with your browser and follow the instructions (you may get errors because of access permissions).

6) Then try example posts from ~/gwbbcode/examples/ especially the short guide ~gwbbcode/examples/howto.txt
