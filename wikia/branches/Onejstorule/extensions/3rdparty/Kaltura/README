Set the following variables to fit your environment:
$wiki_root = /wiki/index.php   <the root URL of the wiki to which all URLs are appended to>
$secret = <the secret given to you by Kaltura to match the partner_id>
$partner_id = <partner_id given to you by Kaltura>
$subp_id = <subp_id given to you by Kaltura>

When debugging the service, it is important to use the log file.
To do so:
1. in partner_settings.php: set $log_kaltura_services  
	$log_kaltura_services=true
2. create a directory called 'log' in the same directory as this file.
	Make sure it has write permission.
If all works well, a file called 'kaltura_extension_log' will be created and contain info about each service request.
