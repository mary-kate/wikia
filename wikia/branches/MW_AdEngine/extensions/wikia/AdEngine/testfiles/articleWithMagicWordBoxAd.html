The film version of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim's</a> Broadway show <i><b>Into the Woods</b></i> was optioned in 1993, and went through years of pre-production.
</p><p>Originally, the film was to be produced by <a href="/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s American Zoetrope company, with puppets by <a href="/wiki/Jim_Henson%27s_Creature_Shop" title="Jim Henson's Creature Shop">Jim Henson's Creature Shop</a>. 
</p><p>The script was written by <a href="/index.php?title=Lowell_Ganz&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Lowell Ganz">Lowell Ganz</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Babaloo_Mandel&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Babaloo Mandel">Babaloo Mandel</a>, who were known at the time for their hit movie <i>City Slickers</i>. Sondheim and librettist <a href="/index.php?title=James_Lapine&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="James Lapine">James Lapine</a> were signed as consultants on the film.
</p><p>Fansite <a href="http://www.sondheim.com/faq/works.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sondheim.com/faq/works.htm" rel="nofollow">Sondheim.com</a> described the content of a 1994 draft of the script:
</p>
<dl><dd>"The story basically follows that of the show's first act, although the story unfolds in a different manner, without a narrator or a Mysterious Man.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>"Several confusions of the play have been fixed. For example, Rapunzel is no longer related to the Baker, nor does she give birth to twins, so the question of why the family curse didn't affect her has been erased.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>"At the end of the first 'act', the Giant rises from his fall and goes on a rampage, allowing the rest of the story to unfold more-or-less as it did in Act II of the play. The intricate back stories of the Baker's father and the witch's mother have been deleted, eliminating "No More" and changing a bit of "Last Midnight." There is no 'second bean', so the Baker's wife's scenes with Cinderella are fairly different. Finally, at the very end of the movie the wife reappears, having tricked the Giant into thinking she was dead.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>"Strangely, there has been no effort to integrate "Children Will Listen" into the action. Rather, the camera just switches to a shot of the witch singing the song against a backdrop of Rapunzel's tower, followed by a montage of the survivors going about their lives after the giant. Although there will certainly be more work done on the script before it becomes a film, what we've seen is certainly promising, and will definitely be entertaining, even if it's not the <i>Into the Woods</i> we all know and love."
