To install:

Add this line to LocalSettings:
 Require_Once ($IP . '/extensions/XSoundBox.php');

Since Adobe Flash Player can only handle MP3 files we need to convert other files first.
This is done with sox/lame combo, so you'll have to make sure both programs are installed and avaiable for HTTP server.

SoX can be obtained here: http://sox.sourceforge.net/
Lame can be obtained here: http://lame.sourceforge.net/

Few globals:

Special dir for storing converted sound files...
 $wgXSoundRepoPath = $IP . $wgUploadPath . '/XSounds/';
... this dir must be accesible through WWW interface, and here you're defining it's URL:
 $wgXSoundRepoURL = $wgServer . $wgScriptPath . $wgUploadPath . '/XSounds/';
Last but not least! A Flash file:
 $XSoundFlashFile = $wgServer . $wgScriptPath . '/Jukebox.swf';
